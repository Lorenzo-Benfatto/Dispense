In this folder I will upload the various notes I wrote in LaTeX while studying for some subjects at University. They're all interpretations of the lectures and they are in no way to be taken as material suitable to study for an exam. Not that I actually believe that anybody would turn to these notes for such a purpose, that is.
Anyway, it is what it is. For the moment it's all in Italian.
I study physics btw.
\\
Sinfonia is a Quantum Mechanics (incomplete) note.
\\
Metodi 2 is a mathematical methods for physics 2 note, explaining complex analysis and distributions.
\\
Physica est ommnis divisa in partes tres is a physics 3 note, answering the questions that could be asked at the exam.
I'm uploading the pdf file along with the TeX one but on God you won't be seeing me uploading the shit ton of images I used.
